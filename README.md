# EnhancedObservableCollection

Observable Collection is updated whenever CollectionItem is Changed.
Since the screen is updated whenever there are many items added to 'Collection', there may be performance problems.
When a large amount of data is added to 'Collection', this method is to update after being added without updating the screen.
